# Project description
Well Pata service is a platform where we connect service providers with potential customers. The customer can find different services around him or her.Then can arrange on how the service will be delivered . 
We just act as middlemen connecting the customer and the service provider

Pata service helps customers get any service they want at a very easier and faster way.
